      <p>hi hi hi hi hi hi hi <strong>creating <u>web</u> page</strong></p>
      <br>It says that "Policies on these demo Left 4 Dead dedicated L4D servers we host are enforced by clients and not by GameServers.com."
      <img src="cat.jpg" width="100%">
      <br>But the gameserver website shows that my server is a "demo server."
      <p>Do you know why this is so? Why is my server written as a demo? I'm pretty sure I correctly made the payment, but it seems gameserver isn't paying much attention to the quality of my server</p>Or perhaps is it because 
      set the server to operate for only a month?
